# ðŸ¤“ Hi, Iâ€™m @caseytraina
________________________

## Resume
- I learned my first language, the beloved **Swift** when I was 12 on a flight home from the Carribbean. Then, for the next few years I messed around in Xcode and completed various [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) Courses. Then, came @CS-at-GA __AP Computer Science Principles__. Then, finally, I completed an **Indepedent Study** last year alongside Mr. Oswald, where we spent the first half of the year adventuring into various topics and finished with a *little* conversational AI experiment. 

## Motivation
- Coding has always been my passion; it relieves my stress, makes time fly by, and gives the best feeling when you successfully write a program. There isn't anything specific I hope to get out of this class. I just wanted some sort of Computer Science course in my schedule this year, so I didn't forget everything!

## Out of Class
- Computer Science/Engineering is definitely what peaks my interest the most, but I enjoy any and all STEM-related courses. Outside of the classroom, I'm interested in basketball and student government (and Warzone).

## Goals
- [X] Sign up for the class
- [ ] Make some cool stuff

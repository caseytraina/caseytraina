## About Me
- I learned my first language, the beloved **Swift** when I was 12 on a flight home from the Carribbean. Then, for the next few years I messed around in Xcode and completed various [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) Courses in everything from JavaScript to C++ Unreal Engine Game Dev. Then, __AP Computer Science__ in high school. Then, finally, I completed an **Indepedent Study** in my junior year alongside Mr. Oswald, GA CS Department Head, where we spent the first half of the year adventuring into various topics and finished with some conversational AI trained on text messages. I now attend __Stanford University__ where I am a B.S. Candidate for __Computer Science__ with a focus in __Artificial Intelligence__. 

## Motivation
- Coding has always been my passion; it relieves my stress, makes time fly by, and gives the best feeling when you successfully write a program.

## Out of Class
- Computer Science/Engineering is definitely what peaks my interest the most, but I enjoy any and all STEM-related courses. Outside of the classroom, I'm interested in basketball and student government (and Warzone).

## About Me
I'm from a small suburban town outside Philadelphia and am fascinated with all things tech and basketball.

I first started programming when I was 10, on the way back from vacation. I worked my way through the Swift Programming Guide—first creating a CLI rock-paper-scissors game.
For the next few years, I continued developing iOS games, a soft spot I'll always have. In high school, I moved onto to conversational AI research, building a program from the ground up to automate my text messages.

Now, I study CS at Stanford University and am the cofounder and CTO of [Overlap](www.overlap.ai), where we build multimodal ai agents for video editing

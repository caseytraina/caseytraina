## About Me
I'm from a small suburban town outside **Philadelphia** and am fascinated with all things tech and basketball.

I first started programming when I was 10, on the way back from vacation. I worked my way through the **Swift Programming Guide**—first creating a CLI rock-paper-scissors game.
For the next few years, I continued developing iOS games, a soft spot I'll always have. In high school, I moved onto to conversational AI research, building a program from the ground up to automate my text messages.

Now, I study CS at Stanford University and am the cofounder and CTO of [Vastly Podcasts](www.vastlypodcasts.com), where we are trying to redefine what a modern podcast player looks like through algorithmic short-form discovery!

## Motivation
- Coding has always been my passion; it relieves my stress, makes time fly by, and gives the best feeling when you successfully write a program.

#### Don't forget the famous words of Mr. Worldwide: 
> Have me a good time,
> before my time is up
